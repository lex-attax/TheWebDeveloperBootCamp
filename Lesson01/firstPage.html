<p>Lorem Ipsum is <strong>simply dummy text</strong> of the printing
 and typesetting industry. <em>Lorem Ipsum</em> has been the
 industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
 when an unknown printer took a galley of type and 
 scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has 
 survived not only five centuries, but also the leap
 into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially
 unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the
 release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum 
 passages, and more recently with desktop publishing
 software like Aldus PageMaker including versions
 of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
